# Normies

This is the factory of packages provided to Conformism users. Some of them are meta-packages, some others are useful 3rd-party softwares not available at distributions repositories.

# Usage

Normies relies on CMake so packages construction is straight forward.

```sh
normies $

	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make pack
```
